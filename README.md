In here we will select Remote Desktop on the right. Go down to User Accounts. Hit Select users that can remotley access this PC. In the Remote Desktop Users box hit ADD.., in here we will put Domain Users, then check names and hit OK. Now all Domian Users by default can now login to the domain as a non admin user.

Open a new file and select desktop and name it create-users and save it. Then we will post our script that will generate random users and hit the green triangle (run script) button on the top bar.

The script will be running making all our users. We will let this run for a bit. All the users being created will be sent to the OU folder we made named _EMPLOYEES.
